      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
        Since I was young I have loved going to amusement parks and in
        particular riding roller coasters. I live in the Detroit metro area so I
        am only a 2 hour drive from Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio so I visit
        there at least a couple of times per year. I've been to a few other
        parks including Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia, as well as
        Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, and
        Busch Gardens in Tampa Bay, Florida. Here is a collection of some of my
        favorite coasters I've ridden.

        <p>
          Maverick opened in 2007 and was built by Intamin Amusement Rides. It's
          fast and low to the ground and features a 95 degree first drop from a
          height of 105 feet along with two linear synchronous motor launches
          throughout the course.

        <p>
          Operating since 1996, Montu is a B&M (Bolliger & Mabillard) invered
          coaster meaning guests are seated below the track. It features

        <h2 id="sv">Steel Vengeance, Cedar Point</h2>
        <p>
          Debuting in 2018 and built by RMC (Rocky Mountain Construction), Steel
          Vengeance is a retrofit of the old Mean Streak wooden coaster that
          once stood here. Its steel I-Box track on wooden frame make it a
          hybrid coaster. Arguably the best coaster on the planet.

        <h2 id="i305">Intimidator-305, Kings Dominion</h2>
        <p>
          Opening in 2010, this 300 foot monster reaches speeds of 90 mph and
          had to be retracked after opening. The turn around out of the first
          drop was so intense many riders would black out. This ride was built
          by Intamin.

        <p>
          Sheikra is a B&M dive machine that opened in 2005. Riders are held
          suspended at the top of the 200 foot verticle drop for several seconds
          before diving towards the ground. It also features some water effects
          towards the end of the course.

        <p>
          Incredible Hulk opened in 1999 and features a tire propelled launch
          out of the station and 7 inversions. In 2015 the ride track was
          replaced to extend the life of this popular attraction.

        <h2 id="mag">Magnum XL-200, Cedar Point</h2>
        <p>
          The original hyper coaster (over 200 feet tall) and fabricated on site
          by Arrow Dynamics, this coaster started the coaster wars when it
          opened in 1989. The first of its kind, other parks around the world
          spent the next 25 years trying to out do one another by building
          taller, faster, steeper and more extreme. A true classic.
